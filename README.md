-> manage admin
-> logout
# faculty login has
---> here the faculty login is based on the credentials provided by admin while managing the faculty
-> view details
-> change password
-> view workload
-> logout
# by this project we can manage the worload of the faculty. when the faculty has other work other than the class work then that work was added by manully and when the faculty has other work no work should be allocated to the faculty 
# we also managed the constraints like same faculty should not be allocated to 2 classes at same time and same class should not be 2 faculties and when the faculty has already work he should not be allocated for other works.
